        <h1>Take A Trip, See The Sights, <br>
            Save The World </h1>
        <p>Star race car Lightning McQueen and the incomparable tow truck Mater take their friendship to exciting new
            places in Cars 2 when they head overseas to compete in the first-ever World Grand Prix to determine the
            world's fastest car. But the road to the championship is filled with plenty of potholes, detours, and
            hilarious surprises when Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international
            espionage.

                <h2>What Would Mater Do?</h2>
                <p>Cars 2 continues the unlikely best-friendship of Lightning McQueen and Mater, and also required the
                    tow truck to drive the film’s action-adventure plotline. “What would Mater do?” became the mantra
                    for Pixar’s creative team as the story entered each new locale. The character of Finn McMissile was
                    revived from a discarded scene in Cars, in which the ultracool spy car starred in the drive-in movie
                    Sally and McQueen were attending.</p>

                of the town. But Mater’s favorite title is best friend to Lightning McQueen. Mater values each and every
                dent he’s earned on his escapades with Lightning over the years, and anxiously awaits further fun with
                his friend when Lightning returns with his latest Piston Cup.</p>

                three-part exhibition race that will take him around the globe.</p>

            <h2>Italy</h2>
            <p>After adapting the Grand Prix races to the real cities of Tokyo and London, the filmmakers decided to
                create the Italian Riviera town of Porto Corsa from whole cloth. Though fictional, Porto Corsa proudly
                displays the influences of Vernazza, Genoa, Positano, Monte Carlo, and Portofino. “We wanted it to be
                our love letter to European racing and to Italy,” explained Co-Director Brad Lewis.</p>

            <h2>Paris</h2>
            <p>After jettisoning plans for a 24-hour endurance race through Paris, the filmmakers gave the City of Light
                a more mysterious role. Inspired by classic action-thriller films, they used Paris for a chase veering
                away from the postcard imagery of the usual lush travelogue backdrop. The Pixar team found inspiration
                in vintage photos of Paris’s old central market, Les Halles, to create an unexpected setting for the
                black market storyline.</p>

            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>London provided the Cars 2 art team’s biggest challenge, requiring over 50 miles of city streets and
                thousands of uniquely "car-ified" buildings exhibiting a wide variety of architectural styles. Along
                with celebrated landmarks like Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, the filmmakers got to make distinctively
                British characters out of such revered vehicles as Range Rovers, Jaguars, Minis, and the London
                double-decker bus.</p>
